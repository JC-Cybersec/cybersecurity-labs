# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Labs

Welcome to my curated set of cybersecurity labs covering blue team, red team, SIEM, SOAR, and hybrid cloud environments. All labs are self-contained and designed for home lab use using Proxmox, cloud services, and open-source tools.

## üìñ How to Use
- Each lab has its own folder with setup steps, diagrams, and sample artifacts.
- Use `/tools/` for detection rules, queries, scripts, and playbooks.
- `/platform/` contains reusable cloud and Proxmox deployment templates.

## üß† Lab Goals
- Practice practical detection engineering and response
- Learn common attack paths
- Automate security operations
