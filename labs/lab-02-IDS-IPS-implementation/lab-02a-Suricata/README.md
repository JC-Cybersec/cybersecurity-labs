# Lab 02-A - Suricata Implementation

## Goals

## Tools Used

## Explanation of Lab Setup

In this lab we are going to install Suricata and set it up as an IDS and then as an IPS. The only real difference in the two is that the IDS version sits out-of-line of your network traffic, whereas the IPS sits in-line with the traffic and your network traffic wont reach your other devices if Suricata chooses to drop the packet, much like a firewall. We will then trigger a predefined rule to see what the log data looks like. After that we will create a custom rule and trigger that rule. IMPORTANT: Make sure that whatever network connection the device is on is in promiscuous mode. You will not be able to see all of your network traffic without usign promiscuous mode.
